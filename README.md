### Hi there 👋

My name is Katharina, I am a data specialist for R&D projects in fields like cultural heritage and data journalism. Sometimes I describe myself as 'data journalist turned data scientist'.

- 🔭 Last project was [Remove NA - a LGBTIQ* knowledge graph](https://github.com/cutterkom/remove-na-lgbtiq-queer-knowledge-graph), results on [queerdata.forummuenchen.org](https://queerdata.forummuenchen.org/en)
- 📫 How to reach me: kontakt@katharinabrunner.de | @cutterkom on Twitter
- ⚡ Fun fact: My generativeart package earns more and more stars on this plattform here and is widely used for NFTs. I am really **not** a fan of all Blockchain, NFT and Web3 related topics. Why? Read this text ["The Third Web"](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/). Sorry, not really funny.
